Portfolio Description -
- the main purpose of my website was for it to be clear to comunicate information presented, making sure it was easily navigatable. I would like to come back to this project inn some months time andd try adding a more consistent theme, styles and how the page structure presents the information (probaly work on my flexbox skills)

- Its main features include a Nav Bar locate at the top of the page, interactive when hovered over and providing a pathway for the next page. ALso used on my blog posts were a side navigation bar, this was used to make access blogs easier and having the choice on which path you take to get there (prevent bottle necking). It also includes a styled logo image of mysel placed in the lefthand corner ( i would have loved to make the image itself it more interactive). My about page has the most use of flexbox within my portfolio, its something i struggled with to keep consistent an understand where the problems were located. Theres definietly a noticable difference between where its used and where it isn't (clear borders and structured text).
